                    <h2 class="inner_content_title">Main Types of Fixed Income Instrument</h2>
                    <p>There are three main types of fixed income: Fixed Coupon Bonds (FCBs), Floating Rate Notes (FRNs) and Inflation Linked Bonds (ILBs)</p>
                    <h4>Fixed Coupon Bonds (FCBs)</h4>
                    <p>Fixed coupon bonds pay a fixed rate of return per annum based on a “yield” to maturity. The yield takes into account the coupon or interest payment on the bond, as well as any capital gain or loss to be realised over the life of the investment.<br>
                        Fixed coupon bonds that are purchased at first instance in the primary market and issued at $100 will pay the same yield to maturity as the coupon rate. Bonds that are priced below $100 are said to be trading at a “discount” to face value and bonds priced above $100 are said to be trading at a“premium” to face value.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Floating Rate Notes (FRNs) </h4>
                    <p>FRNs pay a floating rate of return per annum based on an expected yield to maturity. This return is forecast based on the benchmark reference rate known as the Bank Bill Market (BKBM). BKBM changes on a daily basis and is a forecast of market interest rates over a set period of time. A floating rate note pays a fixed coupon above the BKBM and normally pays a quarterly interest payment which resets every 90 days. Due to these resets, the coupon payment for FRNs will go up and down with changes in short-term interest rate expectations. The yield to maturity is forecast based on the expected interest rate changes over the life of the FRN.</p>
                    <ul class="content_list" style="margin-bottom:48px;">
                        <h4>Inflation Linked Bonds (ILBs)</h4>
                        <p>Inflation linked bonds or ILBs pay a fixed yield p.a. to maturity on top of the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation readings. ILBs pay quarterly coupons which adjust with the quarterly CPI readings. There are two types of ILBs:</p>
                        <li>Capital Indexed Bonds<br><span>Capital indexed bonds adjust the capital value of a bond with changes in CPI. This “indexation” continues until the bond matures, at which time the bond holder receives the inflation adjusted capital value of the original face value of the bond. The coupon payment on the bond is fixed and is based on the CPI adjusted capital value of the bond. For example a capital indexed bond with a coupon of 4% with an original face value of $100,000 and initial capital value of $100,000 will adjust upwards with 2% annual CPI to $102,000 capital value over one year. The 4% coupon is then paid on this higher $102,000 capital value.</span></li>
                        <li>Inflation Indexed Annuity Bond<br><span>Indexed annuity bonds pay a CPI linked annuity revenue stream. Unlike nominal fixed and floating rate bonds, which pay a coupon payment and then return face value to the holder at maturity, annuity bonds repay holders a quarterly income stream over the life of the investment, which includes a coupon payment as well as a partial return of face value.</span></li>
                        <p>A common example of an annuity type investment is a typical residential mortgage, where borrowers repay the bank periodic payments of both principal and interest equating to an annual rate of interest.<br>
                            Indexed Annuity Bonds pay an inflation adjusted return to the bond holder, via an annuity revenue stream similar to a typical residential mortgage. The return paid to bond holders above inflation is known as the “real yield”. Where mortgage borrowers normally pay the same repayment amount each period, an Indexed Annuity Bond will pay a higher repayment amount each quarter as inflation rises.

                    <h4>Why Investing in Fixed Income Fund?</h4>
                    <p>Firstly, Bonds beats Shares when Corporate Default<br>
                        When you invest in a corporate bond and the corporate has difficulty in meeting its obligations. You rank equally with the banks and will have priority over equity or hybrid investors when the proceeds of asset sales are applied. If you held a share that share might become worthless if the company went into liquidation.<br><br>
                        Secondly, Bonds beats Term Deposits in Returns<br>
                        Although both corporate bonds and term deposits have good capital preservation qualities, the returns on term deposits are traditionally meagre. Corporate bonds could provide returns as high as 12% while term deposits traditionally lie well below this currently between 1-2% further. Further term deposits cannot be sold in the secondary market and do not have the potential for capital appreciation like bonds do.<br><br>
                        Thirdly, Bonds have Varies Risks Types and Credit Levels to Diversified Risk<br>
                        While shares and term deposits share the same risks themselves, and the bonds can be chosen to achieve purpose diversified risk with the known returns.
