                        <h4>Fixed Income </h4>
                        <p><strong>What is Fixed Income Instruments</strong></p>
                        <p>Corporate bonds are generally offering higher returns than government bonds because they are considered to be the higher risk. However, corporate bonds are in the top pyramid to other types of investment types. This means if the company is having financial difficulty, the holders of corporate bonds would generally have priority to claim their capital back before other debts and shareholders.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits of Fixed Income Instruments</strong></p>
                        <p>Fixed Income Instruments have essential roles in a portfolio that outperformed other instruments, it includes:</p>
                        <li>Capital Preservation <br><span style="padding: 0;"> The return (coupon rate) of Fixed Income Instruments, or coupon accumulated is generally higher than the term deposits. This means bonds are appealing to investors who want to save to fulfil future liability, such as saving for children’s education and to those who do not want to invest in the risky asset. On the other hands, investment in equity has more risk of losing the capital.</span></li>
                        <li>Income <br> <span style="padding: 0;">Most bonds provide the certain ‘fixed’ level of income on a schedule to investors, such as quarterly, semi-annually or annually. Bond issuers decide the income rate will depend on inflation or set in fixed before the bonds reach maturity date. Compared to equity investment, fixed income investments pay a predictable income amount.</span></li>
                        <li>Diversification <br><span style="padding: 0;"> Unlike equity, bonds have more stable income streams, and equity and bond market returns sometimes have an inverse relationship, i.e. bonds tend to rise in value when equities fall. Consequently, bonds in a portfolio significant diversify investment and reduce risk. Generally, 'put in all the eggs in a basket' is very risky.</span></li>
                        <li>Capital Appreciation <br><span style="padding: 0;"> There is the opportunity that bond prices rise, including a reduction in interest rates and an improvement in the credit rating of issuer from (S&amp;P, Moody’s and Fitch Group). A well-managed, high-quality bond portfolio can appreciate over time with total return delivered from both income and capital appreciation, which at times exceed equity market returns with significantly less risk.</span>
                        </li>
